1. Overview
-----------
Marbles is a totally addictive puzzle game for your palm that doesn't
eat all your memory! For just 11K of your precious Palm RAM you're
going to get a great and simple game that you'll find hard to put down.

The only reason why I wrote this port to the Palm was because I love
the game so much - you know you want it - it's FREE and KEWL!

The aim of the game is to clear all of the blocks on the grid by
tapping and removing block 'sets'. If you find clearing the board too
challenging then there is always the high score to try against.

I'm thinking about adding a 2 player mode over infra red - so look
out for updates or drop me an email.

2. Installation
---------------
This archive contains the following files:

README.TXT            - This file
MARBLESSQ_BW.PRC      - Program file, black and white colour only
MARBLESSQ_GREY.PRC    - Program file, grey colours only
MARBLESSQ_COLOUR.PRC  - Program file, full colour only

I've included the separate colour modes so that it makes the program
file smaller - only by a couple of KB - but we're all trying to save
RAM here!

Use palm install tool to install the program file and then tap on
the icon called "Marbles2" on your palm.

3. Instructions
---------------
Once you've installed the app on to your palm, start it up.

You will be presented with the game instructions - but here's an
overview for those who bother reading the readme file :)

The object of the game is to collect square marble sets. The larger
the square marble set collected, the larger the score. A square
marble set is a group of identical square marbles connected to each
other left-and-right, or up-and-down.

The possible score for the square marble set will display in the top
right hand corner - so you can tap around for the best points.

If you have five or less remaining square marbles you will be
rewarded with a bonus score of 150 points - and if you clear the
board entirely you get an extra 300 points.

When you get a high score that you think may beat all others, use
the 'Send High Score' option to email me with your top score and I'll
add it to the leaderboard on the web site.

There is also a two player option if you want to play against a friend.
The game works in the game manner - except that you both work on the
same board to try to get the best score.  At the end of the game, there
is a break down of where the points were gained.

If you experience any problems, please drop me an email and let me
know your Palm OS, model and what you were doing so that I can try to
fix it ASAP - remy@ihatemusic.com.

Otherwise, enjoy, and watch this space for a few more interesting
light weight apps.
